# Style guide for Dos and Doughs
Do’s & Doughs is a bakery/café aimed at young people still in their academic
years. We aim to sell our sweets to students in a “on the go” way while also
offering a reliable place for students to get work done. Focusing on comfort,
accessibility (geographical location), and convenience is key.

1. Logo
    - The logo may used with or without text.
    - If you want to write the name, do not use other styles than the logo with text.
    - Try to maintain a good contrast between the black logo and the background. Do not alter the opacity of the logo.
2. Colors
    - Base colors consist of the following:
        - `#1F1F1F`, for text and other dark elements which requre good contrast with light colors
        - `#FFF8F0`, a slighly warmer white color for the page
        - `#EEE8E1`, for visual enhancements and/or shadows where contrast is not critical
        - `#C8C4BF`, for augmenting visual elements
        - `#5BE262`, a simple green color for indicating important information and/or errors
    - The website emphasizes images as a source of color in order to make them stand out and as such other colors should be avoided.
3. Typography
    - For headers, we use the serif font *Redaction*. Headers are short texts which need to stand out. The base size of headers are 3rem, or approximately 48px, but rem is preferred. Headers must have good contrast.
    - For other text elements, we use *Public Sans*. The base size of paragraphs is 1rem (approx. 16px).
    - Links which are not in UI elements must have an underline or a different color than the rest of the text.
4. UI element design
    - Use rounded corners (border-radius in CSS) where applicable. Use a base radius of 32px, although 4px may also be used for a sharper look. Avoid sharp corners.
5. Layout
    - The main content should be in the center of the screen.
    - All pages must have a navbar and footer.
    - Group related elements together.
6. Images and icons
    - Icons are from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).
    - All images need to use the webp format for efficient compression.
    - An image cannot be used without any text, unless the purpose of the image is purely decorative.
